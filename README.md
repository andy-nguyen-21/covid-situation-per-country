# covid-situation-per-country

1. Description: This project is a practice on my data analyst skills including SQL Server and Tableau.
2. How to use: 
- The first part is about my data exploration session on SQL Server to practice basic query and save the views for the dashboard that I have drafted on my notebook.
- The second part is my session on Public Tableau to create a dashboard about the Covid 19 situation on over the world.

3. Credits
-  I want to thank Alex The Analyst for his introduction and tutorial on [his youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst) about making portfolio for a fresh data analyst like me.
-  I could not have done this without the data that has been shared from Our World In Data team. The data is updated from the beginning of the pandemic until late October 2022.
